## Week 1: 2018-02-17 to 2018-02-23

We deviated from our Gannt Chart a bit, James worked on LSB so I researched and began implementing Green Blue encoding this week.

I created an rough outline for the Green Blue encoding code in `src/main/java/spatial/GreenBlueEncoder.java` and based it on the methodology in the paper.

I researched Green Blue steganography and read through [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7853987/).
